- finally installed auth, firestore, and cloud storage properly
- had to write multiDexEnabled true in android{defaultConfig{}} to fix error
- had a “Unsupported Modules Detected: Compilation is not supported for following modules” error
  - found fix in this thread: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28668252/android-studio-error-unsupported-modules-detected-compilation-is-not-supported
